## What's in the Battery Cycle Data Visualizer?
In the Battery Cycle Data Visualizer, it simplifies the process of creating battery cycle data visualizations using Python, Matplotlib, Pandas, and NumPy. All the user is required to provide is their file; any other configurations are <u>not</u> required, however they allow for further customization of the visualization. These customizations include:
- Plot title name
- What cycles to visualize
- Dimensions of generated visualization

When you generate your visualization, you can also download your cycle-specific data below as a .csv file. Just click the "Download generated cycle data" button below your visualization!

With the Battery Cycle Visualizer app, visualizing battery cycle data is easier than ever, and accessible on any computer :)!
